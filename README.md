# ContactApp2

This is a simple, React-based contact management app modeled after Appleâ€™s native Contacts interface. The app allows users to add and delete contacts through a clean, minimalist design inspired by iOS. Each contact includes a name and phone number, and the list updates dynamically as new contacts are added or removed. The layout is mobile-friendly and built with a focus on smooth user interaction and state management using React hooks and local state.
